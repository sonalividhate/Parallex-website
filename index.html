        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more
            slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance.[1] The technique
            grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation[2] since the 1930s.

            Parallax scrolling was popularized in 2D computer graphics with its introduction to video games in the early
            1980s. Some parallax scrolling was used in the arcade video game Jump Bug (1981).[3] It used a limited form
            of parallax scrolling with the main scene scrolling while the starry night sky is fixed and clouds move
            slowly, adding depth to the scenery. The following year, Moon Patrol (1982) implemented a full form of
            parallax scrolling, with three separate background layers scrolling at different speeds, simulating the
            distance between them.[4] Moon Patrol is often credited with popularizing parallax scrolling.[5][6] Jungle
            King (1982), later called Jungle Hunt, also had parallax scrolling,[7] and was released a month after Moon
            Patrol in June 1982.[8]</p>

        <p>Nature is the ultimate source of our living. Both living and non-living things include nature, and everyone
            is interdependent, which helps maintain the ecosystem. Plants, animals, and humans all depend on nature for
            their survival. It supplies oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, and other necessary components.</p>

            they're still beautiful. Alice Walker
